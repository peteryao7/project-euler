     * If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length

     * For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
     * 
     * -----
     * 
     * Using what we know about the Pythagorean theorem and the triangle 
     * inequality theorem, we can deduce a more efficient way of solving the
     * problem instead of brute force.
     * 
     * Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2
     * Triangle inequality theorem: a + b > c, assume c = hypotenuse
     * 
     * We know that because p is the perimeter, p = a + b + c. Moving a and b
     * to the other side, we get c = p - a - b. Substitute c with this value,
     * and we get:
     * 
     * b = p(p-2a) / 2(p-a)
     * 
     * As long as b is an integer, we know that any triangle with parameters
     * a and p will result in a Pythagorean triplet. 
     * 
     * What about the parity of a and b?
     *     - If either a or b is odd, then c will be odd and p is even.
     *     - If a and b are both odd, then c will be even and p is even.
     *     - If a and b are both even, then c will be even and p is even.
     * Thus, p will be even no matter what a and b are, so we can skip all
     * odd numbers. 
     * 
     * We know, as a property of right triangles, that a < c and b < c. If 
     * we always make a to be the smaller of a and b, we can say that 
     * a <= b < c, implying that a < p/3 and all a's greater than p/3 are
     * not necessary to check.
